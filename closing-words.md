# Closing Words

The purpose of this gitbook isn't to give you the one-key-fits-all solution to writing a VN. Truth be told, it's a long and often tiring journey. This book serves as half codepen, half personal experience log. I share my mistakes and solutions to problems so you spend less time on them. Hopefully you've picked up a thing or two. Practice is important. Always adopt good code-planning practices and plan ahead to make things easier on yourself and your teammates.

In the end, this is your journey. Make the most of it.

### Credits

Thank you to all who've given me the chance to work with them on their own journey into the world of visual novel production.
