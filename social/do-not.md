# Do NOT



## Writing

* Do not skimp on the spellchecking! I'm not giving names, but if your grammar's bad, please get a person with an excellent grasp of written language to help you out. Doubly so if you're writing in a language that isn't your native one!
* Do not write on a whim 100% of the time. Every story, linear or nonlinear, needs a frame to help with planning and fleshing out details. Yes, creativity is good, but winging it all the time can create massive plotholes you'll struggle to cover up later. Winging it also cements the storyline into the script without giving it a chance to be challenged in the draft stage.

## Others

* Do not begin a VN project with the end goal of turning a profit. Some visual novels are highly successful, and this can give you a false sense of hope. Sadly, as it is with the general videogame community, for every success story there are 100 failures that go unheard. If your motivation is purely or overwhelmingly financial, not turning a profit after a few builds can really run you into the ground. Secure your finances by other means, do not turn a 1-2 year game project into a primary source of income.
