# Something Else?

Before you actually venture into VN making, here are some alternate formats to tell your story, just for the fun of it. If they are a better fit for your project than a VN, you should consider switching, rather than fight the flow. Better to actually have a finished product than struggle with a VN project only to abandon it months into the future.

### Text-Heavy Formats

* Novels and short stories: The classic. Writing quality is everything, whereas there usually is little to no art involved. Great if you've got barely any assets.
* Nonlinear HTML text stories: Twine ([https://twinery.org/](https://twinery.org)) is my fave. It's got branched paths and pictures are easy to implement.

### Picture-Heavy Formats

* Comics: For those who draw a lot.

### Non-Interactive Formats

* Short videos: Hands down the hardest of the bunch. Not only do you have to deal with art, storyboarding and music and sound effects, you also have to make it all come together using video editing software, and in a limited timeframe to convey your story. Whereas most VNs go for at least a couple hours, short stories condense all that feeling and eye candy into a couple minutes. If it takes off, though, these get views in the tens of thousands. ...the benefit of this format is no VN coding.
